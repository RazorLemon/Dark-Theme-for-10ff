# Dark-Theme-for-10ff
This is the latest version of The 10ff Dark-Theme for the night owls.

You can find the code in the other file along with this. Here I'll be explaining how to use the code so that as soon as you open the website, you get the theme :D Let's begin...

The First thing you need to do is install an extension called Stylus. You can install it from this link: 
For Chrome - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en
For Opera - https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylus/
For FireFox - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/

After installing it, click on it's icon and then click on Manage > Write New Style. After you've done this, you'll get a pane on the left named "Add Style" along with a lot of space on the right hand side to enter your program.

You're going well! After this, Copy the code from the other file and enter it into the space on the right side.

Alright we're almost done! What you have to do is on the bottom, you'll be seeing a text written which says Applies to Everything. We don't want this code to apply to everything single thing on your browser, right? So here we need to create an exception by entering a URL. You'll be seeing a PLUS icon next to that text(refer to IMG.eg.1). Click on that.

Now you should get a box which says URL with a drop down arrow, don't make any changes to that. Next to it, you should also be seeing another input box, this is where we'll enter the only URL/s on which this program will work.

In that box, enter this url: https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english#

Now in the Add Style Pane, you should be seeing an input box saying "Enter a name". Click on that and enter any name, and also make sure the Enabled check box is checked.

Now just click on the Save button below that name input box, and that's it, you just have to go to the website now and you're good to go! GJ

NOTE - In case you want to disable the style and continue using the default theme, then go to the same URl again, click on the Stylus Icon and Uncheck the checkbox next to the name you have entered for the style.

Also wanted to mention that I added an extra feature in this program so that you can change the size of the word list box(refer to IMG.eg.2) according to your choice by hovering your mouse over the bottom right corner, and clicking and holding your mouse when the mouse pointer changes to an arrow. Then you can move your mouse respective of the change you want to make.
