# Dark-Theme-for-10ff
This is the latest version of The 10ff Dark-Theme for the night owls.

You can find the code in the other file along with this. Here I'll be explaining how to use the code so that as soon as you open the website, you get the theme :D Let's begin...

The First thing you need to do is install an extension called Stylus. You can install it from this link: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en

After installing it, click on it's icon and then click on Manage > Write New Style. After you've done this, you'll get a pane on the left named "Add Style" along with a lot of space on the right hand side to enter your program.

You're going well! After this, Copy the code from the other file and enter it into the space on the right side.

Alright we're almost done! What you have to do is on the bottom, you'll be seeing a text written which says Applies to Everything. We don't want this code to apply to everything single thing on your browser, right? So here we need to create an exception by entering a URL. You'll be seeing a PLUS icon next to that text(refer to IMG.1). Click on that.

Now in the Add Style Pane, you should be seeing an input box saying "Enter a name". Click on that and enter any name, and also make sure the Enabled check box is checked.

Now just click on the Save button below that name input box, and that's it! You're good to go! GJ
